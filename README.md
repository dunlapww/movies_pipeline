# Pythons, Pandas, and Lambdas, Oh My!

## Overview
This application is a fairly simple data pipeline that ingests a csv of movie data, transforms it into a summary of the number of genre movies released each year, and exports the summary as a csv.

## Setup and Execution
To run this application:
- clone this repo locally
- in your terminal, run: `python3 pipeline.py`
- two csvs should be generated:  
  - a csv of bad data
  - a csv of the desired summary output

## My Assessment
Full disclosure, while this application probably only took an hour to build, that doesn't include the day I spent beforehand learning what Python Pandas was.  I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process, and while it doesn't reflect the TDD and inheritance/encapsulation I typically employ (still learning Python module/package structures and pytest), I believe this solution validates the data pretty well and delivers the desired result.  I'm confident I could close my Python knowledge gaps in a couple weeks.  At Turing, we coded largely in rails and did some limited CSV manipulation.  In my previous work I did all csv manipulations in Microsoft Access.  Overall, I enjoyed this.  Thanks for the opportunity!
